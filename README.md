📌 About Me – Puti Windrahmatullah

Hi! I’m Uti, a data-driven creative soul who's just graduated with a degree in Data Science from Institut Teknologi Sumatera. I turn rows and columns into insights, and I’m not afraid to pivot tables. 😎

My journey in tech and analysis has been shaped by:

🧪 Teaching Assistant roles in subjects like Data Spasial (hello QGIS lovers!), C++ programming (yep, I survived pointers), and good ol’ Word & Excel (even taught Macros like a boss).

📈 Internship as a Data Analyst, where I dove deep into spreadsheets and dashboards, using tools like Google Sheets, Tableau, and Looker Studio.

🤹‍♀️ Leadership in campus media, managing publication, analytics-driven content creation, and video production that actually boosted engagement (yesss, metrics matter).

I’ve also worked on:

🧠 Machine learning projects (Random Forests, CNNs—bukan stasiun TV ya)

🌱 Land cover classification with NDVI

🧷 Data labeling from image tasks to spatial mapping with QGIS

And if you ask me about my favorite skill? It’s combining problem-solving with visual storytelling—because pretty charts that tell a smart story? Chef’s kiss. 🤌

Ping me if you want to talk data, dashboards, digital content—or just vent about why NaN always shows up uninvited. 😉
